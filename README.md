===========

The data file to download is at the address https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

it must be downloaded to the working directory

Then you use run_analysis.R and it creates the two tidy files

- tidy-UCI-HAR-dataset.txt merging the training set and test set in one single set
- tidy-UCI-HAR-avgs-dataset.txt with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
